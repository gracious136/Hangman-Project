# Hangman Game in Python
This project is an implementation of the classic Hangman game using Python. The game prompts the player to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters. The player has a limited number of attempts before the hanging man is completed.

## Installation Instructions
To run the Hangman game, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, there are no external dependencies or libraries required. 
However, You should install 'random' library.

## Usage
* Run the game by executing the Python script.
* The game will present a series of underscores representing the hidden word.
* The player's task is to guess the word by suggesting letters one at a time.
* Enter a letter and press Enter.
* If the letter is correct and part of the word, it will be revealed in the appropriate position. Otherwise, a part of the hanging man will be drawn.
* The player continues guessing until either the word is completely revealed or the hanging man is completed. The game will display a message indicating whether the player has won or lost.

## Features
* Random selection of words from a predefined word bank.
* Limited number of attempts before the game ends.
* Visual representation of the hanging man's progress.
* Display of previously guessed letters to avoid duplication.

## Future Improvements
* Adding difficulty levels with different word lengths or limited attempts.
* Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive experience.
